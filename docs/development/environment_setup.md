# Environment Setup (Draft)

This repo will host multiple services. Setup details will be filled in as the first runnable versions land.

- Connector (Raspberry Pi): Python 3.x, virtualenv, `requirements.txt` (TODO: list packages and setup steps).
- Core API (FastAPI): Python 3.x, FastAPI, database (SQLite/Postgres), `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` (TODO: add exact commands).
- Dashboard (Next.js): Node + npm/yarn, Next.js (TODO: add version constraints and scripts).
- Mobile (future): SwiftUI or React Native/Expo (TODO: decide and document).

Update this file once each service has an initial runnable build and install commands.
